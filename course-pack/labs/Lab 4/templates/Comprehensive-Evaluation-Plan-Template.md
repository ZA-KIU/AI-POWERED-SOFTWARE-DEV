## 2. Golden Set Design

### Overview

**Definition:** A standardized set of 50+ test cases covering typical, edge, and adversarial scenarios

**Purpose:**
- Measure AI accuracy objectively
- Track performance over time (regression testing)
- Validate improvements after changes

**Composition:**
- 70% typical use cases (35 cases)
- 20% edge cases (10 cases)
- 10% adversarial/safety cases (5 cases)

### Typical Use Cases (35 cases)

**Category 1: [Standard Case Type]**

| Test ID | Input | Expected Output | Acceptance Criteria |
|---------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| T001 | [Description] | [Expected result] | - [ ] Criterion 1<br>- [ ] Criterion 2<br>- [ ] Criterion 3 |
| T002 | [Description] | [Expected result] | - [ ] Criterion 1<br>- [ ] Criterion 2 |

**Example (Receipt Scanner):**

| Test ID | Input | Expected Output | Acceptance Criteria |
|---------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| T001 | Clear grocery receipt (Whole Foods) | Merchant: "Whole Foods Market"<br>Date: "2024-10-15"<br>Amount: $87.43<br>Items: [12 items] | - [x] Merchant exact match<br>- [x] Date within ±1 day<br>- [x] Amount within ±$0.01<br>- [x] >80% items extracted |

[Continue for all 35 typical cases]

### Edge Cases (10 cases)

**Purpose:** Test boundary conditions and unusual inputs

| Test ID | Input | Expected Behavior | Why Testing This |
|---------|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| E001 | Faded 6-month-old receipt | Attempts extraction, flags low confidence | Common real-world scenario |
| E002 | Receipt in foreign language | Extracts numbers, translates if possible | Global users |
| E003 | Crumpled receipt | Preprocesses, attempts extraction | Users mishandle receipts |

[Continue for all 10 edge cases]

### Adversarial/Safety Cases (5 cases)

**Purpose:** Test security, privacy, and safety boundaries

| Test ID | Input | Expected Behavior | Why Testing This |
|---------|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| A001 | Blank image (no receipt) | Returns error: "No receipt detected" | Prevent hallucination |
| A002 | Credit card photo | Rejects with: "Cannot process sensitive documents" | PII protection |
| A003 | Prompt injection attempt | Ignores injection, processes normally | Security |

[Continue for all 5 adversarial cases]

## 5. Automated Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid

```
       /\
      /  \  E2E Tests (5%)
     /____\
    /      \  Integration Tests (15%)
   /________\
  /          \  Unit Tests (80%)
 /____________\
```

**Unit Tests (80%):**
- Test individual functions in isolation
- Fast to run (<1 second per test)
- Cover edge cases and error handling
- Target: >80% code coverage

**Integration Tests (15%):**
- Test component interactions
- API endpoint tests (request → response)
- Database operations (CRUD)
- AI API mocking (test without real API calls)

**E2E Tests (5%):**
- Test complete user journeys
- Browser automation (Playwright)
- Slow but comprehensive
- Run before every deployment

### Test Implementation Plan

**Week 6:**
- [ ] Set up testing framework (pytest for backend, Jest for frontend)
- [ ] Write first 20 unit tests
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD

**Week 8:**
- [ ] Write integration tests for all API endpoints
- [ ] Add database test fixtures
- [ ] Target: 60% code coverage

**Week 10:**
- [ ] Write E2E tests for critical paths
- [ ] Set up automated test runs on every PR
- [ ] Target: 80% code coverage

---

## 6. Performance Evaluation

### Latency Testing

**Methodology:**
- Use k6 or Locust for load testing
- Test with 10, 50, 100 concurrent users
- Measure P50, P95, P99 latencies

**Targets:**
- P50: <2 seconds
- P95: <3 seconds
- P99: <5 seconds

**Load Test Script Example:**
```python
# k6 load test
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '1m', target: 10 },  // Ramp up to 10 users
    { duration: '3m', target: 10 },  // Hold at 10 users
    { duration: '1m', target: 0 },   // Ramp down
  ],
};

export default function() {
  let res = http.post('https://api.example.com/upload', { /* data */ });
  check(res, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'latency < 3s': (r) => r.timings.duration < 3000,
  });
}
```
