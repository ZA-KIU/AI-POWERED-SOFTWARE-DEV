**Example Completed Section:**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Improvement

### Challenge 1: Workload Imbalance

**Description:** Team Member 2 (Alice) is carrying 60% of the backend work because she has more experience with FastAPI. Team Members 1 and 3 are less confident with backend tasks.

**Impact:** Alice is overworked (15 hours/week vs. target 10), while others have capacity. Risk of burnout. If Alice gets sick or overwhelmed, we're blocked.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Pair programming sessions: Alice + Bob on backend (2 hours/week)
2. Alice documents backend architecture (1 hour)
3. Bob takes on next backend task with Alice as reviewer
4. Redistribute 2 backend issues from Alice to Bob

**Owner:** Team lead (Charlie) to coordinate, Alice to mentor

**Target Date:** Week 6 (Bob independently completes backend task)
