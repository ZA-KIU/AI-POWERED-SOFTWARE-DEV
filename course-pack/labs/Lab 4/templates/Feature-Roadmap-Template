## 🎯 Selected Design Pillars

### Overview

From the 20-Pillar Design System, we selected the following pillars as most relevant to our project:

| # | Design Pillar | Why Selected | Priority |
|---|---------------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | [Pillar Name] | [1-sentence justification] | High/Medium/Low |
| 2 | [Pillar Name] | [1-sentence justification] | High/Medium/Low |
| 3 | [Pillar Name] | [1-sentence justification] | High/Medium/Low |
| 4 | [Pillar Name] | [1-sentence justification] | High/Medium/Low |
| 5 | [Pillar Name] | [1-sentence justification] | High/Medium/Low |

**Pillars We Considered But Rejected:**
- **[Pillar X]:** Rejected because [reason - e.g., "not essential for MVP"]
- **[Pillar Y]:** Rejected because [reason - e.g., "requires capabilities beyond our scope"]

These are non-negotiable features essential for our MVP:

| Feature ID | Feature Name | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Owner | Week |
|------------|--------------|------------|---------------------|-------|------|
| 1.2 | [Name] | As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit] | - [ ] Criterion 1<br>- [ ] Criterion 2<br>- [ ] Criterion 3 | [Name] | 5 |
| 2.4 | [Name] | As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit] | - [ ] Criterion 1<br>- [ ] Criterion 2<br>- [ ] Criterion 3 | [Name] | 6 |

| 4.3 | [Name] | As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit] | - [ ] Criterion 1<br>- [ ] Criterion 2<br>- [ ] Criterion 3 | [Name] | 10 |

**Why These Features?**
- [Justification referencing user needs, business value, technical feasibility]

---

### Enhanced Features (Should Have - P2)

Features we'll build if time permits, in order of priority:

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Why Valuable | Effort | Include If... |
|------------|--------------|--------------|--------|---------------|
| 2.8 | [Name] | [User benefit] | M | We finish P1 features by Week 12 |
| 3.5 | [Name] | [User benefit] | S | We have 1 extra week |
| 5.2 | [Name] | [User benefit] | L | We're ahead of schedule |

---

### Nice-to-Have Features (Could Have - P3)

Features deferred to post-course development:

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Why Deferred | Future Priority |
|------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1.9 | [Name] | [Reason - e.g., "Requires 3rd party API we don't have time to integrate"] | High |
| 4.7 | [Name] | [Reason - e.g., "Polish feature, not essential"] | Medium |
| 5.6 | [Name] | [Reason - e.g., "Complex algorithm, research needed"] | Low |

---

## 📊 Priority Matrix

### High Impact, Low Effort (Do First) ⭐

| Feature ID | Feature | Impact | Effort | Week |
|------------|---------|--------|--------|------|
| 1.2 | [Name] | High | Small | 5 |
| 3.1 | [Name] | High | Small | 6 |

**Rationale:** These are quick wins that deliver significant user value. Build these first to establish momentum.

---

### High Impact, High Effort (Plan Carefully) 🎯

| Feature ID | Feature | Impact | Effort | Week |
|------------|---------|--------|--------|------|
| 2.4 | [Name] | High | Large | 8-10 |
| 4.3 | [Name] | High | Large | 11-13 |

**Rationale:** Critical features requiring significant investment. Allocate sufficient time and test thoroughly.

---

### Low Impact, Low Effort (Quick Wins) ✅

| Feature ID | Feature | Impact | Effort | Week |
|------------|---------|--------|--------|------|
| 2.8 | [Name] | Medium | Small | 14 |
| 3.5 | [Name] | Low | Small | Bonus |

**Rationale:** Build if time permits. Don't prioritize over high-impact features.

---

### Low Impact, High Effort (Avoid) ❌

| Feature ID | Feature | Impact | Effort | Decision |
|------------|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| 5.9 | [Name] | Low | Large | Cut from MVP |

**Rationale:** Not worth the investment for MVP. Consider for future only if users explicitly request.
