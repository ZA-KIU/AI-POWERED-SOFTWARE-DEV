# Demo Day Preparation Workshop

**Building AI-Powered Applications | Week 13 Lab Part 2**  
**Focus:** Video production, presentation structure, final sprint planning

---

## 🎬 Part 1: 90-Second Video Production

### Why This Matters

Your 90-second video will:
- Be embedded in your README (first thing recruiters see)
- Drive signups if you launch publicly
- Show your presentation skills
- Account for 1.5 points of your final grade

**Analysis of 500+ SaaS launches shows:** Talking-head format drives 100+ new signups in 24 hours.

---

### The Formula (Tested on 500+ Launches)

**0-15s: The Hook (Face on Camera)**
- Start with founder's face
- State the pain point emotionally
- Create immediate connection

**15-45s: The Solution (UI Overlay)**
- Show the product working
- Focus on the "magic moment"
- Voiceover while screen recording plays

**45-75s: The Value (Mix)**
- Show metrics, results, testimonials
- Cut between face and data/screenshots
- Prove the impact

**75-90s: Call to Action (Face on Camera)**
- Back to founder's face
- State the URL clearly
- Simple thank you

---

### Video Script Template

Copy this into a Google Doc and fill it out as a team:

```markdown
# 90-Second Video Script: [Your App Name]

## Hook (0-15 seconds) - FACE ON CAMERA

### Visual:
[X] Founder on camera, well-lit, facing camera
[X] Clean background (or blurred)
[X] Good audio quality

### Script:
"I'm [Name], and we built [App] because [emotional pain point]."

EXAMPLE:
"I'm Sarah, and we built TaxAI because I used to spend 4 hours 
every Sunday dreading tax prep, missing time with my family."

YOUR HOOK:
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

### Why This Hook Works:
- [ ] Personal (uses "I" not "we")
- [ ] Emotional (describes pain, not features)
- [ ] Relatable (target users nod along)
- [ ] Specific (4 hours, every Sunday)

---

## Solution (15-45 seconds) - UI OVERLAY

### Visual:
[X] Screen recording of app in action
[X] Show the "magic moment" (the wow factor)
[X] Cursor movements smooth and intentional
[X] No loading spinners (edit them out)

### Script:
"Then I built [App]. [Describe what happens in the demo]."

EXAMPLE:
"Then I built TaxAI. I upload my receipts, and Claude reads 
them instantly. The AI fills in every tax form automatically. 
What took 4 hours now takes 5 minutes."

YOUR SOLUTION SCRIPT:
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

### The "Magic Moment" You'll Show:
(Describe exactly what you'll screen-record)

_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

### Why This Section Works:
- [ ] Shows, doesn't tell (actual screen recording)
- [ ] Focuses on ONE core flow (not everything)
- [ ] Highlights the AI (the assignment requirement)
- [ ] Includes time savings or value metric

---

## Value (45-75 seconds) - MIX OF FACE + DATA

### Visual:
[X] Cut between founder and results
[X] Show metrics, charts, testimonials
[X] Can include short user quotes

### Script:
"[State the impact with numbers or testimonials]."

EXAMPLE:
"We tested with 50 users. They saved an average of 3.5 hours. 
One user, Maria, said: 'I got my Saturday mornings back.' 
We calculated you'd save $280 per year just in stress and time."

YOUR VALUE PROPS:
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

### Metrics/Results You'll Show:
- Metric 1: _________________________________
- Metric 2: _________________________________
- Metric 3: _________________________________

### Testimonial/Quote (if you have one):
_________________________________________________

### Why This Section Works:
- [ ] Quantifies the benefit (hours, dollars, ratings)
- [ ] Includes social proof (testimonials)
- [ ] Connects to emotional outcome (got time back)

---

## Call to Action (75-90 seconds) - FACE ON CAMERA

### Visual:
[X] Back to founder's face
[X] Same setup as opening
[X] Confident, direct eye contact

### Script:
"Try it live at [URL]. Thank you."

EXAMPLE:
"Try it live at taxai.app. Upload a receipt right now and 
see the magic yourself. Thank you."

YOUR CTA:
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

### Your Deployed URL:
https://___________________________________

### Why This CTA Works:
- [ ] Clear action (try it, visit URL)
- [ ] Repeats the URL (say it + show it on screen)
- [ ] Ends with gratitude (professional)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This:

1. **Just screen recording** (no face = no connection)
2. **Talking too fast** (nervous energy, hard to follow)
3. **Showing everything** (pick ONE core flow)
4. **No clear CTA** (viewers don't know what to do next)
5. **Bad audio** (echo, background noise, too quiet)
6. **Over 90 seconds** (viewers drop off at 1:30)
7. **No metrics** (just features, no value proof)

### ✅ Do This Instead:

1. **Start with your face** (builds trust immediately)
2. **Speak slowly** (rehearse 3x, time yourself)
3. **Focus on magic moment** (one wow moment is enough)
4. **End with face + URL** (clear next step)
5. **Test audio first** (record 10-sec test clip)
6. **Edit ruthlessly** (keep it tight, 88-90 seconds)
7. **Show the impact** (saved X hours, made $Y, rated Z stars)

---

## Video Examples to Study

### Excellent Examples:
1. **Loom Launch Video** (founder + UI format)
2. **Linear Product Demo** (clean, focused)
3. **Cal.com Launch** (emotional hook + clear value)

### What to Learn:
- How they hook you in first 5 seconds
- How they show product without explaining everything
- How they prove value (metrics, testimonials)
- How they end with clear CTA

(Instructor will show 2-3 examples during lab)

---

## Embedding in README

After exporting your video:

1. **Upload to YouTube** (unlisted or public)
2. **Add to README.md:**

```markdown

---

## Section A: Introduction (0:00-0:30)

### Template:

```
"Hi, I'm [Name 1], [Name 2], and [Name 3]. 

We built [App Name] to solve [problem]. 

[One sentence about the problem magnitude or impact]

Let me show you what we built."
```

### Example:

```
"Hi, I'm Sarah, Alex, and Mike.

We built TaxAI to eliminate the hours people waste on tax prep.

In the US alone, people spend 13 hours per year on taxes—that's 
4 billion hours of collective frustration.

Let me show you what we built."
```

### Your Introduction Script:

```
Team Names: _____________________________________

App Name: _______________________________________

Problem: ________________________________________

Impact/Scale: ___________________________________

Transition: _____________________________________
```

---

## Section B: Video Demo (0:30-2:00)

### What to Do:

1. **Announce the video:**
   "Here's a 90-second demo of how it works."

2. **Play the video**
   - Make sure audio works
   - Stand to the side (don't block screen)
   - Don't talk over the video

3. **Transition to live demo:**
   "Now let me show you the app live."

### Technical Checklist:

- [ ] Video embedded in presentation slides
- [ ] OR video URL ready to click
- [ ] Audio tested before presentation
- [ ] Backup: Video on USB drive
- [ ] Backup 2: Video on phone (can AirPlay/cast)

---

## Section C: Live Demo (2:00-8:00)

### The 6-Minute Demo Flow

This is the most important section. **Plan every click.**

### Demo Planning Worksheet:

```markdown
## Live Demo Script (6 minutes)

### DEMO STEP 1 (90 seconds)
What I'll do: _________________________________________
What the AI does: _____________________________________
What I'll say: ________________________________________
Expected result: ______________________________________

### DEMO STEP 2 (90 seconds)
What I'll do: _________________________________________
What the AI does: _____________________________________
What I'll say: ________________________________________
Expected result: ______________________________________

### DEMO STEP 3 (90 seconds)
What I'll do: _________________________________________
What the AI does: _____________________________________
What I'll say: ________________________________________
Expected result: ______________________________________

### HIGHLIGHT: Multi-Vendor Fallback (90 seconds)
"Notice we're using [Primary Provider]. If it fails, watch what happens..."

How I'll demonstrate: __________________________________
What I'll say: ________________________________________

### CLOSING (30 seconds)
Final statement: ______________________________________
Transition to case study: _____________________________
```

### Demo Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Show AI working in real-time (not preloaded)
- ✅ Narrate what's happening ("Now the AI is analyzing...")
- ✅ Highlight the "magic moment"
- ✅ Show multi-vendor fallback if possible
- ✅ Keep each step under 2 minutes

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Show loading spinners for 30 seconds (boring)
- ❌ Say "This usually works..." (tests confidence)
- ❌ Skip steps (audience gets lost)
- ❌ Go silent while app loads (keep talking)
- ❌ Show admin panel or settings (users don't care)

---

## Section D: Case Study (8:00-10:00)

### 2-Minute Technical Deep Dive

You need **3-4 slides maximum:**

### Slide 1: Architecture Diagram (30 seconds)

**Show:**
```
User → Frontend (React/Next.js)
       ↓
   Backend API (FastAPI/Express)
       ↓
   LLM Router (Multi-Vendor)
       ├→ OpenAI (Primary)
       ├→ Anthropic (Backup)
       └→ Ollama (Local fallback)
```

**Say:**
"Here's our architecture. The frontend sends requests to our 
backend, which routes to multiple LLM providers. If one fails, 
we automatically fall back to the next."

---

### Slide 2: Tech Stack (30 seconds)

**Show:**
```
Frontend: Next.js 14, TailwindCSS
Backend: FastAPI, Python 3.11
AI: OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini), Anthropic (claude-haiku), Ollama (llama3.1)
Database: PostgreSQL, Redis (caching)
Deployment: Vercel, CI/CD with GitHub Actions
```

**Say:**
"We chose Next.js for the frontend because [reason]. FastAPI 
for the backend because [reason]. Multi-vendor AI for reliability."

---

### Slide 3: Key Decisions (30 seconds)

**Show 3 key decisions:**

1. **Why Multi-Vendor?**
   "We implemented fallbacks because OpenAI went down for 6 hours 
   in December 2023, costing companies $14K in lost revenue."

2. **Why [Your Model Choice]?**
   "We use Haiku for simple tasks ($0.80/1M tokens) and GPT-4o 
   for complex analysis ($2.50/1M tokens), optimizing for cost."

3. **Why [Framework Choice]?**
   "We chose FastAPI because we needed async support for handling 
   multiple concurrent AI requests."

---

### Slide 4: Metrics (30 seconds)

**Show key numbers:**

```
Performance:
- Average latency: 1.2 seconds
- Fallback success rate: 99.8%
- Cost per query: $0.003

User Impact:
- Time saved: 3.5 hours/week (average)
- User rating: 4.8/5 stars (n=50)
- Cost reduction: 60% vs GPT-4 only
```

**Say:**
"Our app responds in 1.2 seconds on average. The fallback chain 
has a 99.8% success rate. Users save 3.5 hours per week and rated 
us 4.8 stars."

---

## Presentation Rehearsal Checklist

### Practice Sessions (Minimum 3x)

**Rehearsal 1 (Sunday):**
- [ ] Run through entire 10 minutes
- [ ] Don't worry about perfection
- [ ] Identify sections that are too long
- [ ] Time each section

**Rehearsal 2 (Monday):**
- [ ] Fix timing issues from Rehearsal 1
- [ ] Practice transitions between sections
- [ ] Test backup plans (if internet fails, if demo breaks)
- [ ] Get feedback from teammate

**Rehearsal 3 (Tuesday):**
- [ ] Final polish
- [ ] Practice with actual timer (10 min hard stop)
- [ ] Simulate demo day environment
- [ ] Check all team members speak

---

## Backup Plans

### What If Internet Fails?

**Plan A:** Use mobile hotspot
- [ ] Test hotspot speed before demo day
- [ ] Have phone charged and ready

**Plan B:** Pre-recorded demo video
- [ ] Record full 6-minute demo
- [ ] Have video on laptop + USB drive
- [ ] Narrate over the video live

### What If Demo Breaks?

**Plan A:** Have test account with pre-loaded data
- [ ] Create "demo" user account
- [ ] Pre-load example data
- [ ] Test this account 5x before presentation

**Plan B:** Screenshots/video
- [ ] Take screenshots of each step
- [ ] Walk through screenshots if live demo fails
- [ ] Explain: "Here's what it looks like when it works"

### What If Time Runs Over?

**Cut the case study:**
- Show only Slide 1 (Architecture)
- Say: "Full details in our GitHub README"
- End with CTA and URL

---

## Team Coordination

### Speaking Roles (Recommended)

**10-minute presentations work best with role assignments:**

| Section         | Speaker      | Backup       |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Introduction    | Person 1     | Person 2     |
| Video (silent)  | All (watch)  | All (watch)  |
| Live Demo       | Person 2     | Person 1     |
| Case Study      | Person 3     | Person 1     |

**Why 3 speakers?**
- Shows team collaboration
- Keeps audience engaged (different voices)
- Reduces pressure on any one person

**Meeting Before Presentation:**
- [ ] Decide who speaks when
- [ ] Practice handoffs between speakers
- [ ] Agree on backup plan if someone freezes
- [ ] Test all technology together
